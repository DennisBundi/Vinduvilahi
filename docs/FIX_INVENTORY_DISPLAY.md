# 🔧 Fix: Stock Not Showing on Products Dashboard

## The Problem
- Products are created successfully ✅
- Inventory function is called ✅
- But function returns `false` ❌
- Result: No inventory created, stock shows as "N/A" ❌

## Root Cause
The `initialize_product_inventory` function doesn't have `SECURITY DEFINER`, so RLS policies block it from inserting into the inventory table.

## ✅ SOLUTION (3 steps, 5 minutes)

### Step 1: Run the Fix SQL
1. Go to: **https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/pklbqruulnpalzxurznr/sql/new**
2. Open: **`supabase/migrations/FIX_INVENTORY_NOW.sql`**
3. **Copy the ENTIRE contents**
4. **Paste** into Supabase SQL Editor
5. Click **"Run"** (or press `Ctrl+Enter`)
6. Wait for success message

### Step 2: Verify Function Was Fixed
Run this query:

```sql
SELECT routine_name, security_type
FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_name = 'initialize_product_inventory';
```

**Expected result:**
```
routine_name                    | security_type
initialize_product_inventory    | DEFINER
```

If it shows `INVOKER`, the fix didn't work. Try again.

### Step 3: Fix Existing Products
The SQL already includes a fix for existing products, but if you want to manually fix them:

```sql
-- Create inventory for products that don't have it
INSERT INTO inventory (product_id, stock_quantity, reserved_quantity)
SELECT p.id, 0, 0
FROM products p
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM inventory i WHERE i.product_id = p.id
)
ON CONFLICT (product_id) DO NOTHING;
```

### Step 4: Test
1. **Wait 30 seconds** (for schema cache to refresh)
2. **Create a new product** with stock quantity (e.g., 10)
3. **Check terminal** - you should see: "Successfully created inventory for product..."
4. **Check products dashboard** - stock should now show

## What the Fix Does

1. ✅ Adds `SECURITY DEFINER` to function (bypasses RLS)
2. ✅ Grants execute permissions to all roles
3. ✅ Creates inventory for existing products without it
4. ✅ Updates function to SET stock (not ADD)

## After Running the Fix

The terminal should show:
```
Initializing inventory for product <id> with stock: 10
Successfully created inventory for product <id>
```

And the products dashboard should show the stock quantity!

## If Still Not Working

1. **Check terminal logs** - what exact error do you see?
2. **Verify function exists**: Run the verification query above
3. **Check Supabase logs**: Go to Logs → Postgres Logs to see function errors
4. **Share the error messages** and I'll help debug!
